  Our first destination was the big and bustling city of Shanghai, characterized
  by its electric skyline and stylish streets. However we did find pockets of
  more traditional Chinese culture tucked away in the metropolis - there's more
  to Shanghai than meets the eye!

Our first stop was People's Park in the centre of Shanghai, known for its marriage markets (which we didn't know at the time). We didn't snap too many photos as the weather plummeted to a UK standard not long after we arrived!

One of the many ancient ceramic vases we photographed at the Shanghai Museum. We were amazed at their intricate detailing and craftmanship, even more so because of how old they were! China definitely trumps England in the pottery charts.

We thought that this particular ceramic piece looked like a shabbier version of one of Ian's mum's cakes (her cakes are very good - here's the link if you like cake as much as we do.)

We had to stop and chuckle at this ancient sculpture, which though it does have some skill in it, looks camp as fuck. Plus it looks like this demon-like character is stomping on a baby.

There were a few Tibetan masks on display - this being one of the larger ones. We were impressed that actors would have to hold these up on stage, but we wouldn't want to see one of these at night that's for sure.

The Jade Buddha temple was disappointing for us, as the original structure was renovated and commercialised leaving nothing more than overpriced shops. The jade it has stored wasn't disappointing though - check out this huge clump! We really liked the reflections of the modern city buildings trapped in the coloured stone.

One of the Gods of the Twenty Heavens within the temple. This one was our favourite, his stern expression made us feel as though we'd got into some serious trouble.

Next up was Yu Garden, which was a spontaneous activity but much more to our liking than the Jade Buddha temple. A large winding section filled with greenery and rocky formations, it was a refreshing and peaceful retreat in the midst of the city.

It took way too long to get this shot with our barely there camera skills and dark backdrop, but I was so chuffed with my new friend Sealy from the aquarium, that it had to be done. Sealy came out with me every day after, but she has since sadly broken and is waiting to be repaired.

Yu Garden backed onto an open market square with some fascinating shops, both traditional and modern. Our first stop was for some soup dumplings - a hit with the locals - which came neatly with a straw. Ian here is tackling a crab roe soup dumpling, which was pretty tasty but quite fiddly to eat.

A scenic, tranquil spot at Yu Garden. We could have stayed here for hours sitting peacefully by the lake, however we just about managed to explore most of the place before it closed for the day. We'd recommend getting there mid-morning for an enjoyable, relaxing time.

It was a rainy dreary day and we took a long and dreary day trip to Qingbao. It took us hours more than it should have to get there because we had no English signs or Google Maps to get us there, however once we'd arrived and revived ourselves with some food and honey pomelo tea, we enjoyed browsing the narrow market streets and river town.
