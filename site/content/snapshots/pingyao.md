  We arrived expecting a small and quiet traditional town, but we met by a
  commercial tourist infested nightmare. It still had its merits, but China's
  economic boom really does appear to have swallowed up everywhere.

Picturesque buildings covered with red lanterns and greenery. We found that the streets were made even livelier by all the colours in the sunlight.

Pingyao at night, where the lights reflect on the streets and give the sky a blue haze. It's still just as busy here at night as it is in the day time.

Taking a break in one of the quieter spots in Pingyao. Here we had one of the nicest dishes we'd ever had - roasted duck with an apple sauce.

Our resident dog at our hotel. The poor dog was chained up all day and didn't have much room to move around, or much attention it seemed. There were a lot of dogs in bad shape around Pingyao and a lot of strays, which was quite sad.

There were quite a few karaoke spots and this one had a very committed woman belting out Chinese hits.
