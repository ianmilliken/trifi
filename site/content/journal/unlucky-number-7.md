Confessed Travelholic talks about 8 kinds of travelers you’ll meet on the road:

1. **Mr. Aspiring Underwear Model**
2. **The Stoner/Hippie/Bob Marley Fan**
3. **The Instant Best Friend**
4. **The Creepy Old Man**
5. **The Pair in Love **(us yippee!)
6. **The Hot Foreigner Who Doesn’t Speak Your Language**
7. **The Traveler Who Shouldn’t be Traveling**
8. **And of course, The Gap Yearers**

Now we all want to find numbers 2 and 3 (and 6 for all the singletons who like a challenge). Number 1 could be a bit too cocky; with number 4 you’d hope that they didn’t know where you were staying, and I unfortunately have a slight inverted snobbery when it comes to pampered gap yaarr kids.

A main part of the attraction of going travelling was the chance we’d get to meet a whole bunch of different people, from all walks of life. In all likelihood you’ll meet some strange folk along the way but this didn’t dint my hopes of meeting cool, fun and really interesting characters.

So far we hadn’t met anyone - we really hadn’t seen many travellers in Shanghai and barging in on a group’s drinking session in our Beijing hostel wasn’t our style. It had only been 5 days since our arrival but this was my first backpacking trip and I’d always heard people’s stories of randomly meeting others and going on to travel with them or have crazy-fun experiences. I wanted this to happen.

I suppose here the phrase, “all good things come to those who wait” was apt, because note to self, eagerly trying to make friends with anyone who talks to you isn’t going to turn out how you’d hoped.

## We got sunstroke

Our second day in Beijing started off promising. We went to Ritan park in the morning, which is a huge place home to the Temple of the Sun. As we wandered along the many paths we found people practising martial arts or dancing with the help of a stereo. Actually nearly everywhere we went in China, dancing in public spaces was very popular with the locals. Ritan park was a beautiful place with countless trees, a lake surrounded by rocky formations, and stony steps which led to an ornate sun pavilion high above the ground. Up here we saw above the treetops and out to the surrounding cityscape. It was very impressive. But all this walking around in the sun for hours didn’t do us any good. After a few hours we headed to Tiananmen Square, feeling fatigued but excited to get through our agenda for the day.

Has anyone been to Tiananmen Square? Though a major tourist attraction, I found it to have a less friendly atmosphere, with people staring at us a lot. And we didn’t find Tiananmen Square to be the great attraction we’d thought it would be. Perhaps it’s because we were getting grumpier from the heat and fatigue, and we prefer natural attractions. But what we knew for sure was that staying in the centre of this 44 hectare (or 440,000 square metre) unshaded concrete spot was overkill. So dejected and exhausted, we went back to the hostel for a night in.

## A change in spirits

That night as we were finishing our card game in the common room and getting ready to go up to bed, I had a tap on the shoulder. Before being able to turn to see who it was I heard a pinched male voice saying something along the lines of: “You’re English right? I heard you talking and finally I recognised the accent”. There were a lot of Chinese travellers, Germans and other foreigners here. This one was English. He sounded well-spoken - one of those accents that you can’t place. We introduced ourselves and started talking.

Well would you look at that - we met someone! He seemed okay, but there was something about him that wasn’t quite right, something which I couldn’t put my finger on. It wasn’t a laid back conversation. He was very chatty and flamboyant. He had a lot to share about himself and he was an extremely eager beaver to hang out with us. He asked if he could join us the next day and he was perhaps a bit too enthusiastic, but I was an eager beaver too and thought that we might as well give him a chance. He wasn’t a number 3 but at least he wasn’t a number 4! We agreed we’d meet at 10am downstairs and see what happened. As we walked to our room I was pleased, but Ian wasn’t keen. He’d rather we didn’t go out with him. This was his opinion:

> I've backpacked before, met weird people, so I know what to look out for. Within twenty seconds of meeting us, this guy was on a twitchy attack with a monologue on his best qualities, skills, and his career. It was nonsense riddled with creepy laughter and darting eye contact, so naturally he fell into that weird category for me. I didn't want to spend any more time with him, but Clare, excited at making a friend, wanted to give him a chance. This was her first time backpacking, so I didn't want to rob her of that crucial 'meeting a wierdo' experience.

## Clinging like a bad smell

The next day we woke up to Chinese girl screeching at a guy for staying in her room and not leaving. She sounded like she was being murdered, and hounded this guy till he left and the staff came up. This got us up and we headed down early for breakfast. We waited for our friend at 10am, and waited for 40 minutes till he strolled down and eagerly joined us. He said he wasn’t hungry but he ordered food anyway, and this delayed us further. We were annoyed at being kept waiting, and he wasn’t really one for getting to know other people. He was more for telling us about himself, his amaaaazzzzing business ideas which were going to be big (which he didn’t share) and the top magazines he’d written for. He was a music journalist, and had supposedly written for publications like the Guardian, Q magazine despite being young, and others I can’t remember (but not NME because they’re a bunch of dicks apparently). He hadn’t got a portfolio site yet though so we couldn’t see his work. He loved jazz and blues. He told us about how he laughed with his friend in a penthouse in Hong Kong and showed us all the photos. He fancied himself as a photographer and wanted to sell these photos as prints. He was going to Dubai in a few weeks and he mentioned that he had ‘lost his heart in Budapest’.

By this point, I was done. Interesting he was, but self-absorbed and boastful he was too. He sounded like he was from stage school and he was putting on a performance. I made an excuse to go upstairs and left Ian to him. 

## On to Ian

I had the pancakes with a selection of lucky dip fruits again, Clare went with the untried and untested ‘porridge oatmeal’ - she gave it a whimsical 5 out of 10, which is 2 points less tasty than salted scorpion.

Towards the end of breakfast our favourite new appendage reared his bearded face and began chatting to us. He readily refused any interest in our anecdotes and started banging on about himself, as any good appendage would. Clare made herself scarce with the untimely excuse of ’needing to get ready’. I on the other hand had nothing so original prepared, and so had to chew the remainder of my pancakes with a plentiful helping of his bullshit. Luckily maple syrup covered anything is delicious. ****

We were also lucky in that he was set on going to Tiananmen Square as he only had a few days here, so we left him for the hutongs and agreed to meet up later on for the night market. He was really eager to meet with us again and Clare felt bad just ditching him.

Going to the hutongs was the best choice we made, and one of our favourite places in Beijing! (More on this later).

## A tantrum and a trip to the night market

Back at the hostel we had a few WhatsApp messages left by our friend which buzzed through, and then we saw him in the common room. He wanted to take us to the night market but insisted that the later we go the better, so we waited around for a couple of hours. We left at around 9pm, and by the time we got there, most of the stalls were closed. We resigned ourselves to trying the few things that were there - bread-crumbed banana with ketchup, squid and lamb skewers. This is where I also tried salty, crispy scorpion. Ian point blank refused. I was curious but unsure as I looked at the two sellers who were laughing at my curious and unsure expression. Crunchy, slightly gooey and very salty, that's all I can say. Anyway we had a good time at the night market and headed for the metro home.

The last straight train back was at 11.30pm, which we'd just missed, so we had to take a train to a different stop and hope we caught the last train from there. Ian and I were fine as we had metro cards. Our friend on the other hand needed to buy a ticket but the office and machines were closed, the train was arriving. We ran for it, but our friend wasn't happy. The night started to turn sour. He was overly agitated and angry and we didn't know how to deal with him. He became snappy on the train and didn't want to talk. As we got off the first train he just stopped and stood still. He then span around on the spot like a dancer, lifting his arms in the air and breathing out heavily. 

What the fuck.

I stole a glance at Ian, who too looked bewildered. Our friend then said: "I needed to do that, to release energy". Okaayyyyy. I tried to go along with him and likened it to yoga as a breathing based exercise. Then he banged on about how he practises yoga, what kind of girls he likes (not making assumptions but he was flowery as hell), and more. But he was still frustrated about the ticket and the atmosphere he created made the whole thing awkward. Turns out it didn't even matter because he got through the barriers just fine. I was a 15 minute walk to our hostel from the station, where he boasted about staying in a hotel in Milan and that the owners said he could stay there again free of charge. Yawn.

Once back I rushed upstairs but Ian stayed behind to check his phone at the WiFi spot. Our friend lingered, and brought up an email he had from his business mentor. He asked Ian if he'd like to hear the amaaaazing praise he just received from his mentor, saying how amaaazing he was. Ian listened with gritted teeth and then quickly left for bed. 

The next day I was glad to be alone with Ian again, however at breakfast our friend shouted my name from across the room and came to sit with us. I saw Ian's face slightly drop and thought it was my turn to engage him. I waited to see if he'd ask me any questions but he didn't, instead he pulled out his phone and asked me if I wanted to hear the wonderful things his business mentor said about him. I had to restrain a laugh as I looked sideways at Ian, who was probably thinking "not again!". It was a long and flowery speech, suspiciously sounding like something he would write. From what he read out, he was a hero who was saving the world with his business acumen and intelligence. It just didn't add up. I've only known one compulsive liar before but he also seemed to fit the bill to me.

I don't mean this to be a big old bitching session, it's just that this character was unlike anything I expected. When I think of a traveller I picture a kind hippie looking being with beach-wave hair and a cool, calm manner. Or even a wild party-er who's up for anything fun. I suppose this was my naivety, but I was surprised I'd met such a self-centered person.

Anyway I learnt my lesson, and can thankfully say we did meet some lovely people at that hostel naturally, a few days later. There are many types of people out there and giving them a chance is fine and well. But if they're not my cup of tea I will no longer try to make them like me and end up in a muddle!
