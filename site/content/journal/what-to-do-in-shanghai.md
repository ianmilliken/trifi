  recommend if you're planning a visit

Shanghai was probably the best place to start our 10-stop China expedition, since the huge city gave us so much to see and do. It was quite easy to get around on the metro and you’d still be okay with basic mandarin. We loved the noisy, colourful modern streets and the light-filled night skies. Shanghai didn’t disappoint on the more traditional sights either - we found lots of relaxing green spaces with ornamental buildings and caught a glimpse of its fascinating history.

Here’s exactly what we got up to during our stay in Shanghai, and what we’d recommend for those of you who are planning on spending a few days there:

## Where we stayed

In Shanghai we stayed at the Rock & Wood International Youth Hostel, one of the cheaper options about 35 minutes out from the centre of Shanghai by metro. This isn’t too far out seeing as the metro system is currently the world’s largest in route length and covers 588km. Though from Pudong International airport it did take us around an hour and a half to get there, so it was lucky that we arrived in the morning. Our hostel was a 10 minute walk from the metro station and despite only having minimal directions scribbled on a piece of paper and not being able to read mandarin, we managed to find our way without a hitch!

*Note:* this was definitely not the case for the rest of China. Even with the help of Google Maps and the offline map app, MAPS.ME, we got lost on multiple occasions and sometimes only found our way by locals taking pity on us and pointing us in the right direction. If you’ll be around for more than a few days, as soon as you get to China we’d advise you get a Chinese SIM and get data on that shit straight away. This might just save you hours of walking around like a headless chicken not being able to find your way. You can pre-order a SIM before you leave for China or you can usually get one at the airport - the main suppliers are China Mobile and China Unicom. Also, China’s internet use is extremely censored which means no Google Maps, Facebook or Snapchat. If this sounds like something you can’t live with you can get use the Express VPN service. CyberGhost VPN is a free alternative.

The Rock & Wood hostel was quite trendy, with a large rustic wooden table for people to sit at in the common area and a cute little pond/garden area at the front. The room was decent and the staff were nice, but the best part was how cheap the food and beer was compared to what we experienced in the city itself. Wow - 10 yuan for a 500ml beer? 1.19 British pounds?! I think so! Once we found out how cheap it was we mostly ate at the hostel before we went out.

What was lacking though was the atmosphere. It was very quiet when we stayed there, probably because we arrived in September after the peak summer season. But most people staying there were natives and didn’t seem interested in making an effort with non-mandarin speakers. We only spoke to the staff and one other traveler whilst we were there, so if you’re looking for more of a party/sociable vibe and you’re visiting in Autumn this might not be the best place for you. The hairdressers round the corner though was well up for a party - club anthems were booming all through the day till the early hours of the morning.

### *Day 1:* Nanjing East Road and the Bund

With our 14 hour flight - our first long-haul flight ever - we were pretty shattered when we got to the hostel and didn’t want to do too much. So after a long rest we got ourselves ready to hit the town in the evening and take in the city scenery. Our first stop was Nanjing East road, famous for its shopping spots housing premium international brands. To the annoyance of Ian I was comparing everything I saw on our trip with London, so if you know London, Nanjing East Road is like Oxford and Regent Street on a bigger scale. There was so much happening here. All the lights, the shops, the street entertainment and so many people! If people watching is your thing, which it is mine, this is a gold mine. You’ll spot real characters and fashionistas, and maybe even a kid peeing in the bin (peeing in public seemed to be a usual thing in China). The street entertainment was very entertaining indeed but very different from the entertainment in London. We first spotted two middle aged men dancing to a pop song. They were happy doing their own thing, which I can only describe as flowery and not-so-talented. The next performer we saw was an older man turned opera singer. These were the types of acts that would make Simon Cowell scowl, but we thought they were great in their own way.

Peering into the windows of the many shops we walked up and down the street before heading to the Bund. It was about a 25 minute walk (which was a bit longer because we walked the wrong way) but it was well worth the stroll. The huge lit-up skyline could be seen from across the river, which too was lit up by LED pirate looking boats. It was a spectacular sight, with the Bund changing colour and shining brightly. The viewing spot was busy but you can get to the front and snap away if you wait. We ate out in the Sanrio shopping mall which was full of Hello Kitty characters - I loved it! We read online before arriving that eating in shopping mall restaurants is generally cheaper, so we gorged on sushi of all different kinds and managed to get by with our basic mandarin.

### *Day 2:* People’s Park, Shanghai Museum and the aquarium

We’re very into exploring natural sights so we went to People’s Park for a wander. It had elements of the traditional and was a maze of interesting avenues with exotic plants and trees. When we arrived there though, it was raining and crowded with elderly people sitting on stools with umbrellas opened out on the floor. The umbrellas were everywhere and we first thought that they were selling them. But as we walked closer we saw paper attached to each of the umbrellas with a printed photo and text…. I’d read about marriage markets in China before, but didn’t connect it until after, when we found out that this was the biggest one around. Lots of people were crowding to see the umbrella ads, which made it difficult for us to walk through. Here we experienced our first case of the granny-nudge - a phenomenon exclusive to old Chinese women which Ian would come to disdain. You basically get elbowed out the way because the old women believe in their superiority and have to be first. I understand that you should be respectful of your elders, but we still don’t see why this policy gave quite a few of the old women we encountered the right to violate our personal space. Anyway, People’s Park was a bit of a let down for us, so away we went to the museum.

Like many tourist spots in China our bags were x-rayed before we entered the museum and we couldn’t take in our bottled water. Inside, the museum was impressive and spanned over 4 floors. We spent most of our time there in the ceramics section, gazing at all the intricately painted pieces. We were shocked at how old some of the vases were yet still intact. A few from as early around 25 A.D. showed surprising artistry and skill. We also explored the calligraphy, jade and furniture sections. I really enjoyed looking at the expressive strokes of calligraphy, however there are no English descriptions for anything so I could only imagine what their significance and history was.

Yep, it was a very busy day. We headed to the aquarium afterwards but arrived with only 45 minutes to go before it closed. We had to rush through and didn’t get to spend as long as we wanted looking at the brightly coloured and patterned fishes. A highlight though was the long glass tunnel which let us walk below and beside sharks, stingrays and other larger creatures. We also saw two penguins having a scrap and sounding strange war cries - we couldn’t stay to find out who won.

### *Day 3:* Jade Buddha Temple and Yu Garden

{{< 500px

We wanted to visit this temple because it looked beautiful in photos and holds famous Buddhist relics. The Jade Buddha Temple was a bit far out from the centre, and an hour away from our hostel on the metro. When you get off the train at Changshou Road station, you have about a 10 minute walk down the main road and then smaller streets crowded with mopeds, bicycles, and street food outlets surrounded by tables and chairs. It gave off a very different vibe from the main streets in Shanghai, but we enjoyed looking into the small busy restaurants which filled the air with the smells of cooked food and watching people go about their day. As we got closer to the temple, the street began to present souvenir shops manned by people dressed in yellow Buddhist robes. This was the start of the whole commercialised shebang that was ill-suited to us.

The original temple was built in 1882, to keep two jade Buddha statues brought from Burma. However what we didn’t know beforehand was that the temple was destroyed and reconstructed in 1928. The complex of traditional buildings displaying the many different statues imitated the traditional temple and it didn’t feel as authentic. A few of the buildings were only built to house merchandise - beaded bracelets, candles and pieces of Jade. Overall it seemed too commercialised and we didn’t feel it was worth the journey.

*Tip:* never sit on the door frame of the temple like I did accidentally - it’s seen as disrespectful, whoops!

However Yu Garden was a real delight and was definitely worth the trip. It’s a tranquil garden space over 400 years old, featuring a network of many unique pavilions, halls and fish-filled ponds. When we first stepped into the garden we were surrounded by high rock walls, which led up to a great view of the inner garden. It’s a beautiful place, and we would have liked to have spent hours there just relaxing.

Yu Garden backs onto the Yuyuan Bazaar, which is a biggggg contrast to the peaceful space. It’s busy. Also known as Nanshi and Old Town, the market is a big tourist attraction where you can check out tea houses, get famous Nanxiang soup dumplings and other traditional wares. We got the crab roe soup dumplings and they were tasty and fun to slurp through a straw! You can spend a few hours here peeking into the shops and shaded stalls or sitting by the pond in the main square.

### *Day 4:* Qibao Ancient Town

The ancient town of Qibao was built around a thousand years ago and is one of the closest water towns to Shanghai. It was an hour away from our hostel on the metro, so we planned to get there early and spend most of the day walking along the town’s streets. The town is meant to be a ‘spiritual sanctuary’ free from the traffic and pollution of Shanghai’s centre. But by the time we got there, we were anything but feeling spiritual. We were boiling with frustration. Why? Because we can’t follow mandarin street signs. We got majorly lost and it took nearly 3 hours to get there.

When we got off at the station we had no idea where to go, and only had a screenshot of a map to guide us. As soon as we arrived, there were Chinese men leering at me and the area seemed quite run-down so we decided quickly to walk the other way. It was completely the wrong way though, and what should have taken 10 minutes took over an hour. We were hungry and tired from our previous days of rushing around, so we weren’t in good spirits when we finally sat down. It also started to rain so we couldn’t get the camera out and snap the lively market stalls with unusual looking snacks and the ancient bridge running across the canal. We ended up sitting in a cute two-floor cafe by the canal and getting a honey pomelo tea, but unfortunately our tiredness and the stress of the day ruined our enjoyment of the town.

## What we’d recommend

* A visit to see the Bund and Nanjing East Road at night - watch out for the street performers!

* Shanghai museum - even if you’re not the museum type you might be impressed with the beautiful ceramics on display.

* Shanghai aquarium - see the sharks, jellyfish, penguins, tortoises and weird array of fishes… just don’t go half an hour before it closes.

* Yu Garden - spend the day here, there’s a lot going on and it’s an interesting space to eat, shop and relax.

## What we’d do differently

* We’d head to Tianzifang, a French Concession turned into a modern art district. You’ll find independent galleries and craft shops, cafes and music venues among lots of interesting alleys.

* If we spent longer in Qibao we would check out the Qibao Winery.

* Disneyland!
