“Bu Yao Xie Xie” – it's a polite way to say "I don't want what you're pushing", and thanks to the importance of tones in Mandarin there is really only one way to say it right. But in the monumentally irritable state that arose from not getting what she wanted for breakfast and the locals swarming her like she was a pot of delicious honey, Clare found a brand new way to say it.

## Mangos for breakfast, please

On route to the Three Gorges Dam, we made a quick stop off for breakfast at the ‘Mango Cafe’ – one of very few food joints that we encountered in Yichang that had its name in English on its shopfront, which lured us in with hope of English menu's or speakers. We were all for immersing ourselves in Chinese culture and foods, but on this particular morning we wanted breakfast to be a safe bet rather than the roulette we sometimes played with Mandarin menus.

We walked inside – no English menu’s or speakers. Great. With a tight schedule ahead, we didn’t have time to wander around looking for somewhere else.

Fortunately the cafe had a glass food counter which was decorated by an elaborate arrangement of mango based dishes. We put two and two together and came to the conclusion that this place must mainly do, if not exclusively, mango dishes, so menu roulette seemed a safe bet this time around.

We picked at random. As we waited Clare grew giddy with excitement. And then the food arrived – two petite oily ham pizzas. Personally I didn’t mind, I expected something mango-esque but pizza is pizza, and I’d definitely won worse prizes on menu roulette. But the disappointment hit Clare hard, and she got really emotional. Now I’m not going to pin this on pizza because me and pizza go way back, instead I’m going to pin it down on a few weeks of shit sleep, being tired from the travelling and activities, and feeling a bit flustered from the mega heat and humidity.

Clare was sad and teary, so I did what any good guy would do and offered to eat her pizza for her if it would make her feel better. I know, selfless.

We ate up quickly, and set off for the first part of what turned out to be a long day (link coming soon)… To the bus stops!

## Chinese men swarmed us

After a fifteen minute walk we arrived at a myriad of bus stops. One of them was the one we wanted, but we’d have to hunt it down.

In this time Clare’s emotional state had hardened, she was no longer upset but instead terrifyingly subdued and harnessing unchanneled rage. This might not be why people say breakfast is the most important meal of the day, but it should be.

We walked along to the first stop and began looking up its routes, and straight away several Chinese men swarmed to us like Sir Jimmy to his nephews. They were talking quickly at us, and over each other. Their intentions unknown and their words indistinguishable from gibberish, we threw down the ol’ “bu yao xie xie”, but they persisted, ignoring our request, and getting louder and more unintelligible.

The mob came between us and the route map so we turned to make our way to the next stop, but they followed. Again, we tried the ol’, slightly less polite than last time, “bu yao xie xie”, but it had no effect. We packed the pace onto our walk to get away from them and check the other stops, but they chased after us, refusing to fuck off.

And that’s when it happened.

## The incident

Clare stopped, dead still. All the momentum that was charging her forward sunk into her stompy heels as the ground beneath her hit ten on the richter. Her skin flushed as all of the blood in her body went to her tiny mouse sized fists. She clenched, her neck and jaw tightened like vacuum packed sirloin and she gritted her teeth like each end of her jaw was a vice – the gaps that remained spewed saliva like a rabies riddled dog. Her eyes wide and fully dilated, she roared from behind her grit “BUUU! YAAOO! XIE! XIEEEEEEEE!”.

The men stopped, gobsmacked, and slightly drenched in hiss. There was a momentary standoff, but after the men retreated quietly and quickly. I’m glad I didn’t get to see the glare she was giving them, I doubt I’d have slept right for weeks.

I’m quite glad we were hassled to be honest, the rest of our day was filled with blunders and getting lost (link coming soon), and if Clare hadn’t gone loco on those locals then I probably wouldn’t have made it out of Yichang alive.

## Summing up

Travelling for any prolonged amount of time is full of fun and unexpected delights, but it also has its stresses. If you don’t take enough time off from your time off (which I know might sound stupid), those stresses can boil up and turn even the chirpiest of people into a ticking time bomb. However, you can’t always do something about that, so if you feel like you’re going to blow your lid, don’t do it on your travel buddy.

Without thinking too much about it though, there is one very obvious lesson – when a woman expects some mango for breakfast, for god’s sake, do not give her pizza.
