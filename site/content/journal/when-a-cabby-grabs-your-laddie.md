Cabs in Vietnam, heck anywhere in Asia, are cheap – somewhere between the £1-£5 mark will get you from one end of a city to another. However, public transport is even cheaper, and when you’re backpacking for 6 months or more, every penny counts.

Despite this unquestionable money logic, if you have already been travelling for a few hours whilst lugging around all of your shit in muggy, tropical-esque heat, sometimes the cab is worth the extra few pennies.

## Grabbing a cab

Clare and I had all of our gear hauled behind us, and were faced with the last stretch of our journey from Halong Bay to Hanoi. It was dark, late, hot and sticky, and we were tired, so we hailed a cab, threw our stuff inside, and hopped in.

The cabby whacked it into gear but then took off unexpectedly smoothly.

I monitored the meter and watched the driver out of the corner of my eye to make sure he hadn’t pressed one of those special secret buttons that triple the rate. 

We have a system to avoid the dodgy cab-happenings we’d heard about in this part of the world – Clare gets in the back with the bags and I get in the front with the driver. It’s simple, but it means if he does anything dodgy, he can’t lock us both in the back and if needs be then I can have a scrap with him in the front. Foolproof, or so we thought.

## The curious cabby

Not long into the journey, the cabby started looking over at me while he was driving. He looked like he wanted to say something, but with a pretty distinct language barrier in play he just smiled instead. This continued for a minute or two before he reached out and stroked my knee.

Err, what? What is he doing?

I looked down, wide eyed and in slight disbelief, and then up again at him. He pulled his hand back sharply and giggled like a giddy school girl. I tried to ask him what he thought he was doing, but instead a muddle of garbled words and uneasy laughter came out. I was actually speechless. 

He reached out to my knee again and brushed at the tips of the hairs on it before saying something in Vietnamese and pointing towards the hair on my legs and arms, and then gesturing to his own smooth, hairless, foetus-like arms.

“Ahahh!” I thought, “I think he’s just strangely captivated with my body hair”.

I’m not sure that justifies feeling me up, but it at least settled my worries. For now.

The cabby laughed, I laughed, and Clare laughed. The tension in the cab lifted, I let out a huge sigh of relief and turned to Clare to confirm the settling news – it’s just a body hair fascination.

Although, just for clarification, I don’t have a yeti like proportion of body hair on my arms and legs.

The cabby continued to chat in Vietnamese, switching his glance between my legs and arms. Suddenly, it fixed on my johnson. Before I could say “dumplings” he was juggling my nuts through his perverted fingers.

I batted his hand away and shouted “Oi! … What the fuck man?!”

He giggled like a school girl once again, though this time almost drowned out by Clare having the time of her life in the back seat, rocking back and forth in stitches. Good to see she’s not the jealous type. 

## Stalemate

Over the next ten minutes of what has become the longest cab ride of my life, a game of cat and mouse ensued. He continued his unwarranted advances towards no mans land, my arms and legs, and I continued to thwack them back.

He was gaining no ground, and so tried a slightly less direct approach. He noticed my ukulele and started gesturing at it for me to play. Thinking this was just a ruse to get me to expose my goodies as I reached for it, I declined. But he wasn’t giving up, and soon enough was paying more attention to me than the road.

Eager to avoid any more groping and the growing potential of a car crash, I conceded, picked up my uke, and bust out some chill, non-sexual, riffs.

His lust was pacified – thank fuck – and so we made it to the end of the cab ride with no more boundaries overstepped, and a slight discount on the fare, which I guess he felt obliged to give as he’d turned me into a borderline rent boy.

## Take aways

Dodgy cab-happenings don’t just come in the form of a cabby trying to rip you off or pinch your stuff. Sometimes they want some lovin’ too, and unless that’s what you’re into, you’ll need a game plan. I’d suggest this brilliant [self defence lesson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyXhysmMNhE) from Master Ken as a starting point.
