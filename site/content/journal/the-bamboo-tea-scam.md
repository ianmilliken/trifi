  Most friendly talkative strangers you meet whilst traveling are just that, but
  some of them are wankers too.

After a few weeks of being in China, Clare and I were used to gathering a bit (tons) of attention wherever we went. The locals would gawk with limp jaws, snap pictures with their cameras peacocking, and kick up broken conversations whenever they could. There was no blending in.

At first all of the attention was unsettling, it was like being an anxious teenager and going out to a public place knowing that you had a bullseye-shaped spot in the middle of your forehead. But after a few positive encounters we learned to embrace it. We felt like b-grade celebrities and became desensitised to the attention. The paranoid Englishman inside of us was paralytic drunk on friendly “Ni Hao!”s and our guard was down, we’d talk to anyone.

## The Old Man

We were exploring the night time markets of Guilin for the second night in a row, scoffing down our favourite strange foods from the night before. After reaching maximum capacity, we decided to call it a night and started taking a slow stroll towards a nearby taxi rank.

As we did, we matched pace with an old man walking to our right. He was shuffling along slowly with his shopping bags in hand, his head pointed towards the ground and sporting what looked like his concentration face. He saw us from the corner of his eye and looked up with the familiar cocktail of shock and wonder. He then traded in his dropped jaw for a smile and said “Hello!”. We smiled back, but then I yanked Clare away into a store that I suspected might sell some reasonably priced New Balance trainers. It did not. Nowhere does.

Defeated, we slumped back outside. Again we caught up to the old man, to both our surprise and his. He exclaimed “Ah! Hello again!”, and as we walked alongside him a whole conversation unravelled.

He became notably excited, very quickly. It was a little odd but he promptly explained that he was a kids English teacher, and that he was happy to be speaking to some native English speakers. We dipped in and out of various topics over the next 5 minutes until something struck a chord with him.

## Bamboo Tea

We’d found out that he was from a town we were going to visit the next morning (Yangshuo) and that his family were tea farmers down there. He suggested that if it was on our route we should stop by it and try something that was new this season - bamboo tea. It was his favourite type, and he could not recommend it enough. This felt like a natural end to the conversation, and our food babies would be birthing at any moment, so we felt like it was a good time to make an exit.

As we said our goodbyes he had an idea. His family also happened to have a store which was run by his brother just before the taxi rank we were walking to, so he offered us a quick tour of it so he could show us which tea to go for the next day. We were a bit skeptical at this point, but we’d had no reason not to trust him other than that ingrained ‘don’t talk to strangers’ mantra from our childhood’s - he seemed genuine, he wasn’t trying to sell us anything and he wasn’t pushy in the slightest - so we accepted and walked over to the store with him.

## The Family Store

As we approached the store there was a lively atmosphere and a crowd outside gathered around the goods. But when we walked inside all of that disappeared. The store was empty expect for one broody looking man patrolling the shop. He was a wad of a chap, wide and stocky and holding himself in a stance that shouted “I will punch your face off”.

The excited old man picked up the pace of his shuffle and raced towards the jars of stacked tea and began popping off the caps and sniffing. After finding the one he was looking for, presumably that bamboo tea he’d been telling us about, he held it up so we could have a sniff. “Like Jasmine, yes?!” Jasmine? Sure, why not. He was probably just so excited he’d forgotten how to pronounce bamboo. I do that sometimes too.

As we inhaled he turned to the broody man and said something in mandarin, laughing nervously afterwards. The broody man remained broody and silent. The old man then turned to us and told us that the other man was his brother.

The two looked nothing alike, if they’re brothers then I’m Usain Bolt's younger, more athletic sister.
The old man then had a further idea, he wanted us to try the bamboo tea. He waddled over to the back of the store where a tea table lay in wait, and started to boil a kettle. He didn’t wait for us to answer so warning signs were going off for both Clare and I now, she made her ‘this is shifty’ eyes at me and we slowly dragged ourselves towards the back of the store.

“Look”, I said, “we don’t have any money with us so we won’t try any, but thank you.”

“Ah! It’s okay, don’t worry it’s my family shop so you don’t have to buy.” He said, “It’s free. Just try some if you like.”

I listened to his phrasing carefully - he wasn’t being pushy, it sounded like a friendly offering.

The old man asked us to sit down, and the broody man made his way to the back of the store and disappeared behind a camouflaged door to our right. We reluctantly sat and the old man pushed the tea towards us. The broody man reappeared. This time he stood at the back with us, glaring at us and lighting up a cigarette. Clare’s comfort was completely ruffled - she stood up and turned to me. I pushed the tea back towards the old man and we declined again. He was baffled by our behaviour, and again reassured us that there was nothing to worry about, we could try the tea if we liked, he wasn’t going to charge us anything. I hesitantly called him out, trying not to offend.
“Sorry, but we’ve heard of things like this and we don’t want the tea right now.” I said.

“No no! This is not a scam. That happens in Beijing and big cities, but not here, not in Guilin! You don’t have to have the tea. I just thought you might like to try.” He said.

Clare was quite clearly overwhelmed with uncomfortable fishy feelings, so we declined again as we left the store. I thought how things had gone in the store was a little off, but I was pinning that down to the paranoid Englishman inside of me, after all, he had given us every opportunity to not drink the tea, which seemed like a shit plan for a scam.

Not long after leaving we started to feel a little rotten, and as we got chatting we decided we’d got it wrong. The only thing that had seemed a bit off was the offer of free stuff, but we decided that he was just being hospitable. We decided to go back to apologise for how rude we’d been but he was gone. One of the staff we’d previously seen outside recognised us as we approached. He waved and smiled, and asked us if we wanted to pick up where we left of with the tea. We declined and headed home, feeling like jerks. We’d called it wrong, it hadn’t been a scam. Or had it?

## The Following Evening

The next night we were back in Guilin’s city centre after a day trip to Yangshuo. After grabbing some food we made our way through the familiar streets back home. We were nearing the same street where the old man had stopped us the night before when all of a sudden, from our left we heard “Hello! Hi!”.

Great Scott! The old man! Wait, no - we did a double take. It wasn’t the old man, it looked remarkably like him but about 20 years younger. Same haircut, same height, similar face, and he spoke English. Maybe this was the younger brother he was telling us about?

The young man dived right in with some questions, “Ah you’re English? I’m a kids English teacher!”.
Get out of town.

Time slowed, Clare and I turned to each other and desperately tried to can our laughter. We’d still been feeling a bit shit for calling the old man a con artist to his face, and then deciding he wasn’t. But this young man rocking the same lines, same job, and standing in the same spot as the old man could not be a mere coincidence, could it? No. It was ratification that Clare had called it right the night before, and that we had no reason to feel likes dicks. And as a bonus, we now had an excuse to act like dicks to this new chap. It was time to feed some bullshit to this bullshitter.

“Ah you’re an English teacher?” I said “That’s amazing! I’m actually an English teacher too!” (lies)
“Oh, really? Haha, you look like a professor”

“Ah how did you know?! Yes I am a professor in Taiwan, I teach English there to university students” (lies)
“Oh, so you can speak Chinese?”

“Oh no, I haven’t picked it up yet. It’s my first day” (lies)

It went on like this for a while - I fed his presumptions with bullshit and he leapt it up like a dog on a hot day, thinking he was getting the better of us. I told him that Clare and I were on our honeymoon, and he suggested that I might buy her a honeymoon gift. He said his sister lived in Soho, and we said we lived their too.
After a bit of this back and forth, he started on his pitch - the same bamboo tea story that the old man delivered the night before, and then I cut him off.

“Ah yes! The tea here is GREAT, isn’t it! We went down to the Li River today and tried this new variant, it’s from Bamboo leaf. Have you heard of it?! You should try it, it’s the best tea we’ve ever had. We bough 10 kilos of it.”

Young tea man was perplexed. He looked like a retarded rabbit caught in headlights. His efforts of bamboozlement were as effective as trying to piss in a straight line in a gust. His pissy efforts were slapping him right in his face. It was delightful. His efforts scattered, he regrouped and beyond belief he had a backup plan. Though somehow, he hadn’t figured out that we knew what he was up to.

He delivered some new material. He asked us whether we liked the art style of the region – that being the typical calligraphy and traditional style paintings that you’d associate with Chinese culture. His wife apparently had a stall not to far from where we were and he wanted us to see her paintings. Why you might wonder? Because he was honoured to be speaking to native English speakers of course.

Clare and I had our game faces on and wanted to see where level 2 might take us, but we were on the verge of losing our cool. We declined a visit to the young man’s wife’s stall and headed home. Though 3 yards after leaving the man we cracked up, obnoxiously loud. I basically cracked a lung.

## Summing up

Fortunately we avoided being caught by the scam two nights running, the first night due to Clare’s fitting doubts, and the second thanks to the same script being delivered in the same place.

But how do we know it was a scam? I mean definitively? After the whole shin dig we looked online for “Guilin tea scam”. It’s a fairly big hit, and unfortunately some people have been at the rough end of it. The tea isn’t actually free (surprise surprise) and ends up costing an extortionate amount, and if you can’t pay you may be introduced to some fake police officers with pretty scary threats.

What we’ve learned is that there are wankers everywhere you go, and they can be convincingly deceptive. Despite that, we wouldn’t recommend avoiding Guilin, it’s a stunning place and the people were generally lovely. Go there, don’t get scammed, and if you meet an English teacher on the street, don’t try his brother’s tea or his wife’s art.
